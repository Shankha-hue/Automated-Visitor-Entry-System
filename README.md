# Automated-Visitor-Entry-System
Problem- A person will come in front of an entrance and show his face towards the camera. Simultaneously, the person will also need to show a photo identity card to the camera too.
Objective- We will need to verify whether the person's face matches with the face in the photo identity card. We will also need to save the person's name, date of birth, and identity card type & number in a database.
Results- We successfully manage to solve the problem with over 93% accuracy. The model is able to generate correct results with an age difference of upto 35 years between the real face and the ID card face. We are also able to store the required details about the person in our database. The model works for Adhaar Card, Pan Card, Voter Identity Card and Passport.
